
Hi there, I need some assistance with a multi-room sound system I purchased. To be honest, I’m really frustrated. I’ve been trying to get it to work smoothly, but it’s riddled with bugs, and the app is so slow I might as well go back to using CDs!
Where do I start? The app is constantly lagging. I tap on something, and it takes ages to respond. Sometimes it just freezes entirely. And half the time, it doesn’t even recognize my speakers! I have to restart the whole thing. It’s unacceptable for what I paid.
I’ve tried everything I can think of. I’ve reinstalled the app, updated everything, rebooted the speakers—nothing helps. It just keeps happening. And it’s not just one or two issues; it’s like every part of the system is a problem. At this point, I’m ready to send it all back.
Alright. I just can’t waste more time on this. It’s a multi-room system—I need it to actually work in every room, and right now, it’s not. If we can’t fix it, I’ll cancel the order.
